< Rough guide >

- Install tag: `--tags sabnzbd`
- Login is set with what's in accounts.yml
- User will  need to add in categories for `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `lidarr`. 
  Set a relative directory name for each category.
  SABnzbd requires the server to be filled in to set categories up.

- Direct unpack is disabled by default. Left it as-is for user to setup basics.
