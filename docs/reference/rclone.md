## Rclone
This step will take you through the configuration of Rclone.

This is the same process as you went through with [Cloudbox](https://github.com/Cloudbox/Cloudbox/wiki/Install%3A-Rclone).

If you're migrating from Cloudbox you probably want the [Cloudbox migrations instructions](https://docs.saltbox.dev/community/guides/cloudbox/)

With Saltbox we want to set up multiple teamdrives and service accounts form the get-go, with as few manual steps as possible.

That process is still under construction.  Please take a look at the [automated version of this process](../reference/safire.md).
